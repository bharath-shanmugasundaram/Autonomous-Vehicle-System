# Lane-Deduction-
This project showcases a simple lane detection algorithm using OpenCV and Python. It processes video frames to identify and highlight lane lines on the road, which is essential for self-driving cars and driver assistance systems. By applying edge detection and region masking techniques, the algorithm detects lane lines
